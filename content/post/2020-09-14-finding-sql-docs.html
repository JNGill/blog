<p>Like most people, I’m quick to turn to Google when I need to know something, and Google searches for SQL-related questions throw up plenty of results from sites like <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/sql?tab=Frequent">StackOverflow</a>.</p>
<p>However, many companies produce database software, and many of these products are queried using a language called “SQL”. But it turns out that each product has its own dialect. Keywords that work in one product may not work in another - and so the answer you find may not work in your database.</p>
<p>One way to improve your results is to include the name of the dialect of SQL that you need to use in your search. I work with Microsoft SQL Server, which uses a SQL dialect called T-SQL, and so I use search terms like “CREATE TABLE <strong>TSQL</strong>” rather than “CREATE TABLE <strong>SQL</strong>”.</p>
<p>I also tend to start by looking at the official documentation website for the dialect of SQL I’m using, particularly if I just want to clarify a point of syntax. For SQL Server, that’s <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/queries/queries">Microsoft Docs</a>.</p>
