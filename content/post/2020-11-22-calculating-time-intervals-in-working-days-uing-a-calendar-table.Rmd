```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(odbc)

conmssql <- dbConnect(odbc(),
                 Driver   = "SQL Server",
                 Server   = "DESKTOP-5R64MMS\\SQLEXPRESS",
                 Database = "SynthNHS",
                 Trusted_Connection = "True")
                 
knitr::opts_chunk$set(connection = "conmssql")                 
```

```{sql prepareexample, include=FALSE, code=readr::read_file("2020-11-22-prepare-example.sql")}
#prepare example table
```

I sometimes want to look at waiting times or turnaround times measured only in working days. This might be when thinking about a service which is only open on working days. Sometimes I've also seen service-level agreements specify performance metrics measured in working days.

A calendar table - a table in which each record represents a single calendar day - gives you a neat way of doing that.

The code looks like this:

```{sql wdturnaround, output.var = "wdturnaroundtbl", results = 'hide', code=readr::read_file("2020-11-22-turnaround-example.sql")}

```
``` {r wdturnaroundprint, echo = FALSE, rows.print = 20}
wdturnaroundtbl
```

This code counts the midnights between the two dates, as long as the following day is a working day. In particular, requests made on a Friday and completed on Saturday or Sunday have a turnaround of 0 days, while requests made on a Sunday and completed on a Monday have a turnaround of 1 day. The behaviour for these edge cases can be adjusted as desired in the subquery using `CASTS` and choosing between strict and non-strict inequalities.
